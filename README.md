This project is pre-alpha, the state of the project changes rapidly from day to day. Follow us on twitter for updates, [@ProjectPyland](http://twitter.com/ProjectPyland).

## About

Pyland aims to provide a fun and creative environment on the Raspberry Pi (or
other platforms) to aid children learning programming and Computer Science
Concepts. It was started as a summer intern project at the University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory June-August 2014 supported by a grant from the
Broadcom Foundation. It was started by Ben Catterall, Heidi Howard, Joshua
Landau and Ashley Newson under the supervision of Alex Bradbury and Robert
Mullins.

## Install
These install instructions may be incomplete and you may require additional packages to the ones listed here

#### Getting Dependencies (Raspberry Pi)

Install packages from raspbian repo:
```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libx11-dev gdebi libtinyxml-dev g++-4.7 zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends mesa-common-dev mesa-utils build-essential gedit
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost1.50-all-dev python3.2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Download and install extra dependancies:
```bash
mkdir pyl-temp
cd pyl-temp
wget http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ajn44/files/libsdl2_2.0.3-1_armhf.deb
sudo gdebi libsdl2_2.0.3-1_armhf.deb
wget http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ajn44/files/libsdl2-image_2.0.0-1_armhf.deb
sudo gdebi libsdl2-image_2.0.0-1_armhf.deb
wget http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ajn44/files/libsdl2-ttf_2.0.12-1_armhf.deb
sudo gdebi libsdl2-ttf_2.0.12-1_armhf.deb
wget http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ajn44/files/libgoogle-glog0_0.3.3-1_armhf.deb
sudo gdebi libgoogle-glog0_0.3.3-1_armhf.deb
wget http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ajn44/files/libgoogle-glog-dev_0.3.3-1_armhf.deb
sudo gdebi libgoogle-glog-dev_0.3.3-1_armhf.deb
cd ..
```

Get source code using git:
```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends git-core
git clone http://github.com/pyland/pyland
```

#### Compiling on Raspberry Pi

```bash
cd pyland
#Put your python version here (change both PYTHON_VERSION and LIBBOOST_PYTHON). Need at least 3.2.
COMPILER=g++-4.7 PYTHON_VERSION=3.2 LIBBOOST_PYTHON=boost_python-py32 make
```

#### Compiling on Desktop - Unix

For desktop, you will need the packages listed above, many of which can be found on the repos e.g.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
```


For compiling on desktop, use:

```bash
# Set both PYTHON_VERSION and LIBBOOST_PYTHON.
# LIBBOOST_PYTHON is typically boost_python-py32 or boost_python3.
#
# Set COMPILER to the most recent g++ or clang++ version available,
# but at least g++-4.7 or a recent clang++. Plain "g++" is the default.
PLATFORM=desktop COMPILER=g++-4.7 PYTHON_VERSION=3.2 LIBBOOST_PYTHON=boost_python-py32 make
```

Please note that desktop support is secondary, and may be incomplete. At the moment, there is only a Unix version.

##Usage

To launch :

```bash
cd src
./main.bin
```

Keybindings
* <kbd>e</kbd> - open the editor with current sprite's script
* <kbd>r</kbd> - run the script for the current sprite
* <kbd>h</kbd> - stop the script
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> - Hold down when running a script for fast mode (can't use with manual control)

* <kbd>up</kbd><kbd>down</kbd><kbd>left</kbd><kbd>right</kbd> / <kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> - move sprite
* <kbd>m</kbd> - print the focused sprite's location

* <kbd>escape</kbd> - go back to level selection map

* <kbd>=</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> - zooming in and out
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>0</kbd> - return to default zoom level

##API

* `help()` and `help(command)` - Get help on the current task and any in-game (or other) commands.

* `move(direction)` - Move the character in the given direction. Parameter direction: north, east, south or west
* `walkable(direction)` - Determines if the character can move in that direction. Parameter direction: north, east, south or west

* `cut(direction)` - Cuts down vines or logs. Parameter direction: north, east, south or west
* `look(radius)` - Find all objects in a given radius from the character. Parameter: radius of the area to search for objects in.
